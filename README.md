# UpgradCaseStudy-Employee-Retention-Prediction

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to apply the logistic regression model to analyze and predict binary outcomes based on the input data. This assignment aims to enhance the understanding of logistic regression, including its assumptions, implementation, and evaluation, to classify and interpret data effectively.

## Business Objective

A mid-sized technology company is looking to improve its understanding of employee retention to build a loyal and committed workforce. While the organization has traditionally focused on addressing turnover, it now recognizes the value of proactively identifying employees likely to stay and understanding the factors that contribute to their loyalty.

In this assignment, a logistic regression model will be built to predict the likelihood of employee retention based on demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics, and tenure. The aim is to provide the HR department with actionable insights to strengthen retention strategies, foster a supportive work environment, and increase overall stability and satisfaction in the workforce.

## Assignment Tasks

1. **Data Understanding**  
   The dataset will be explored to understand its structure and contents, focusing on features like age, gender, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. This step will identify the key variables influencing employee retention.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   The data will be cleaned by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and ensuring that all data is in a usable format. Data quality will be improved to ensure better model performance.

3. **Train-Validation Split**  
   The dataset will be split into training and validation sets to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated fairly and that it generalizes well to unseen data.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Training Data**  
   EDA will be performed on the training data to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns. Visualizations will be used to better understand the relationships between key variables.

5. **EDA on Validation Data [Optional]**  
   EDA may also be performed on the validation data to refine the model's insights and further assess how well the model generalizes to new data.

6. **Feature Engineering**  
   Based on the insights from the EDA, new features will be created or existing ones transformed to enhance the modelâ€™s performance. This will include handling categorical variables and creating interaction terms where necessary.

7. **Model Building**  
   A logistic regression model will be built using the training data. Hyperparameters will be fine-tuned as needed to optimize the model's performance.

8. **Prediction and Model Evaluation**  
   The model's predictions will be evaluated using the validation set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC will be used to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook or similar environment for interactive development

## Conclusion

By completing this assignment, a deeper understanding of logistic regression and its application to real-world business problems will be gained. The skills developed in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation will be essential for predictive analytics tasks, providing valuable insights into improving employee retention strategies.
